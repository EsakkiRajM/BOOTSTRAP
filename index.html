                    of the committee
                    which reviews internet suspension orders in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
                    A three-judge Bench headed by Justice BR Gavai however agreed with the government that the internal
                    deliberations of the review process need not be made public. <br>

                    The court did not delve on whether the reasons or findings of the review committee need to be
                    published. The Bench said it was for an individual petitioner to raise the plea in the appropriate
                    forum or court that non-existence of reasons, if any, in a final review order affected their right
                    to challenge. <br>

                    “We are not going into that aspect,” Justice Gavai remarked.

                    The comments by MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal came after a February 20 report by The Hindu that
                    at least three Indians who were hired as security helpers by Russia were forced to fight alongside
                    the country’s forces along its border with Ukraine. The Hindu subsequently reported that there are

                    every element of the technical side of running a webpage or application. You will learn to use
                    languages like HTML/CSS and JavaScript to create stunning, visually evocative web pages. You’ll
                    learn back end languages or frameworks, like Python or the MERN stack, to build the server-side
                    infrastructure that allows webpages to function. Thus, learning full stack web development will
                    teach you how to find work building any aspect of a web application or system. It will set you up
                    for future success in fields adjacent to these programming languages, like data science,
                    cybersecurity, or machine learning. With Full Stack Web Developers being in high demand, learning
                    these skills is a great way to break into a high-paying, diverse career field.
